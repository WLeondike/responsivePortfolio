              Growing up I've always been around technology. My father has always been a very 'tech-savvy' person and I have had
              a great amount of exposure to different technological advances. I've always loved technology. I believe that
              technology has caused so many advances in our lives today, let alone the simplicities technology has brought
              into our lives. From access to the internet from almost anywhere with the touch of your fingers, to being able 
              to make different decisions for a character in a movie through an interactive film. I'll always stand by technology,
              and appreciate everything it's done for not only myself, but everyone around the world. We continue to adapt and 
              overcome the challenges that come our way and I feel that technology has had a great impact on our success for 
              survival.

            <p>
              I was born in Camden, New Jersey but we didn't live there long. Before my first birthday we ended up moving down to 
              Florida and I've lived here ever since. Volusia county is considered my home and I had lived there for over 20 years. I love the 
              beach and anything that gets me out on the water or even just being in the sun in general. On my spare time I tend to longboard for
              miles or kayak any chance I get. My father, when I was younger, introduced me into golfing...but as of recently it's become
              more of a passion for myself. I try and be out on the green every week I can. Now that I live in central Florida I'm 
              not able to access the beach so easily anymore.

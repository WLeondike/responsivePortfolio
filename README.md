# My Responsive Portfolio
This is my web portfolio that I'll update throughout the course.

We had to create a webpage that has information about ourselves, as well as a portfolio that we can attach our projects onto. 

They had us include a contact page where you can fill out information about youself, but it currently stays as a work in progress.

### This webpage included three .html files
  <ul>
  <li>index.html (about me page)</li>
  <li>portfolio.html</li>
  <li>contact.html</li>
  </ul>

We had to use some styling of our own, thus having a .css sheet to add a little of our own taste into our web-page.

The website was created by using many of bootstraps features including their .css sheet. 

I also added in bootstraps .js file in order to allow my drop down button to function properly in mobile view. 

We had a strict layout to follow. They provided images for us to refrence when it came to that layout, otherwise this entire 
project was created from scratch while using bootstraps many different tools. 

One of the more challenging things I had to overcome was trying to embed text with link overlays on top of an image for our 
portfolio page. I probably spent the most time here but I had finally overcame it.

# My Responsive Portfolio

Welcome to my responsive portfolio that I'll be updating throughout the course!

This is a webpage that contains information about myself, a portfolio that I will be updating as I become more skilled at coding each day, and a contact page where the user can fill out information about themselves.

There will be links to my resume, LinkedIn, and GitHub pages in the portfolio page. Feel free to grab my email and/or phone number from the resume if you would like to contact me. 

Link to my deployed page: https://wleondike.github.io/responsivePortfolio/
